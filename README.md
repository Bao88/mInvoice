# mInvoice-imitation
A website project I made as an imitation of mInvoice(https://minvoice.no/). 
The purpose is to implement the necessary function to work like mInvoice based on what I saw.
All assets and links in the project forwards to their original resources. 

How to use:
- open the index.html file on any browser and it works

TODO:
- Testing on different browsers
- Test for browser functionalites(old browser).

You can also a live version of the project here:
